# Project Title

Building on Avalanche Contract

## Description

The DegenToken contract is a custom ERC20 token contract that allows for the creation, management, and trading of a unique digital token called "Degen" (DGN). This contract also includes simple functionalities such as the purchasing and transfering of tokens. 

## Functionalities
1. Mint - mints new Degen Tokens and assigns them to the owner's address.
2. Burn - burns specified amount of Degen Tokens from the owner's address.
3. Transfer - transfers Degen Tokens from the owner's address to a certain recipient.
5. Buy Item - allows a users to purchase items using the tokens.
6. Add Item - adds new item to the contract's list.
7. Get Item - gets the details of an item. 

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

You must first have a MetaMask account setup and connected the needed network.

### Installing

To get stated with the project, you'll need too have Remix open it is a web-based Solidity IDE that allows the user to write, deploy, andd test smart contracts.

- Open Remix in your web browser: https://remix.ethereum.org/
- Create a new Solidity file by clicking on the "Create" button.
- Copy and paste the contract code into the new file.
Instead of copying and pasting the contract code, you can also import it directly.

- Download the file and click "Open a File from your File System" to import the contract code into Remix.
Once you've importeed the contract code, you can proceed with compiling and deploying the contract.

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with the contract, follow these steps:

1. Compile the contract by clicking on the "Compile" button in the Remix Solidity compiler.
2. Deploying the contract to the chosen Environment (I used MetaMask) then click on the "Deploy" button.
3. Interact with the contract using the Remix console.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure that you have a MetaMask account setup and connected to the needed network.
- Verify that the contract code is correct and compiled successfully.
- Check the Remix console for any errors or warnings during deployment and interaction with the contract.
